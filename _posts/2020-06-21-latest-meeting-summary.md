The club met this month in Harley Park with a biscuit and gravy breakfast provided by WD6BGN!

To assist with communicating with club members, WD0GYR is coordinating sending notices out with Nixle. If you are a club member and would like to have text messages sent to your phone for club meetings or other club information, please [contact us](/about/contact) and we will get your number added to the list.

The club will also be participating in this year's [Field Day](http://www.arrl.org/field-day). Festivities will be held at the [Prarie Home Fair Grounds](https://www.google.com/maps?q=Prairie+Home+MO+Fair+Grounds) with tower raising and setup Friday, June 26th, and operations from around noon Saturday until around noon Sunday. Anyone, ham or not, is welcome to attend! More information will be posted soon!

Finally, work is being done to perform some maintenance on the club's [repeater](/about/repeaternet#repeater-info).

Please mark your calendars and join us at our next meeting on Saturday, July 11, 2020. Location to be determined.
