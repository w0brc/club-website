While the [2020 Hamfest](/hamfests/2020) is only a few months away, we have been busy working to incorporate additional content and programming that amateur radio enthusiasts may find interesting. To that end, K0PHP (Chris) has been very gracious in agreeing to provide a digital presentation during the hamfest! Various digital topics such as DMR and other modes of interest to the amateur radio community will be discussed and demo'd.

If you would like to see any specific topics covered, please feel free to [reach out](/about/contact) to us with your suggestions and we will pass along your comments.
