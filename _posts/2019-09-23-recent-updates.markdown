It's been over a week since we started the website and several updates have been made. From changes to the main page to the links in the navagation bar at the top, we have been slowly implementing suggestions made by club members.

If you have any content suggestions, recommendations, or requests please feel free to hop onto the club's [repeater](/about/repeaternet.html) and discuss with other club members. We welcome all suggestions and hope to continue building a site helpful to all amateurs in the area.
