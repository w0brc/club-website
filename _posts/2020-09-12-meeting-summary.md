The club met this month on the [W0BRC club repeater](/about/repeaternet#repeater-info).

Have you noticed the "hum" on the repeater is gone? N0QOK, WA0E, and KF0GE visited the repeater site last month and replaced the power supply. It is believed one or more of the capacitors in it was going bad, and the new one has corrected the issue.

Also discussed was getting the rotor repaired or replaced that was damaged during Field Day 2019. Options exist and luckily repairs should be doable.

The club also formally accepted the [club's website](https://w0brc.org) and permanently installed W0MQD as webmaster. If anyone has comments, suggestions, or other topics to include on the website, please feel free to [contact us](/about/contact). We are always looking to make improvements to meet the needs of amateur radio operators in the area.

Lastly, the topic of the [FCC reintroducing licensing fees](http://www.arrl.org/news/fcc-proposes-to-reinstate-amateur-radio-service-fees) was mentioned. The FCC is discussing implementing a $50 fee for various amateur radio applications and is soliciting comments on the matter. No deadlines have yet been set for these comments.

Please join us every Thursday at 8:30 PM on the [club repeater](/about/repeaternet#repeater-info) as we continue to discuss various happenings in amateur radio, chat with area hams, and determine where next monthâ€™s meeting will be held.
