**NOTICE:** BOONVILLE HAMFEST 2020 is **CANCELED**!!!

In an effort to continue to stay transparent about the COVID-19 situation and the impacts on decisions made about the hamfest, it has been decided to **cancel** the hamfest out of an abundance of caution for the general public.

More information about the cancelation will be posted on [our website](/) and/or the club's [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/BoonvilleAmateurRadioClub) if it becomes available.

We greatly appreciate your patience and understanding under these circumstances.
