This month's club meeting was the 2nd on-the-air club meeting held on the [club's repeater](/about/repeaternet#repeater-info). Topics ranged from work to do on the repeater to the [2020 ARRL Field Day](http://www.arrl.org/field-day) from June 27-28. This year the club has assembled a Field Day Committe! With all of the uncertainties surrounding current events, the committee will help plan and coordinate the festivity throughout the coming weeks.

We have also added the [club's consitution and by-laws](/about/constitution) to the site for everyone's viewing. We hope that providing our version of these documents will be a benefit to the community.

The next club meeting is scheduled for [Saturday, June 13, 2020](/about/meetings#meetings).
