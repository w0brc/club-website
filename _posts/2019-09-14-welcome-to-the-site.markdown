Welcome everyone to the new website for the W0BRC Boonville Amateur Radio Club! Over the the next few days/weeks, we'll be working to add new content and features in an effort to make the site more useful for amateur radio operators and anyone interested in the hobby in the central Missouri area.

Thanks again for visiting our site, and we look forward to providing a service to the area!
