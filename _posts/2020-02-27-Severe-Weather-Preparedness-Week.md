Local warning sirens, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.weather.gov/eax/nwr">NOAA All-Hazards Weather Radio</a>, and the Emergency Alert System (EAS) will be activated to signal the start of the drill. **The "TOR" code for EAS and NOAA Weather Radio will be used again this year to simulate what would occur in the event of an actual tornado warning.**
